# Work log and resume point

Use [backlog.md](backlog.md) for ticket checklists and test boundaries. This file
records execution state, not a second copy of the backlog. Dates use ISO format;
include timezone for timed hardware/rehearsal evidence.

## Current state

- Application: not implemented; no runnable Rust/GPUI project yet.
- All M0–M5 implementation tickets: `planned`.
- Next ticket: **M0-01 — Reproducible Rust/GPUI bootstrap**.
- First action: inspect current upstream GPUI minimal application/action examples,
  record commit/paths/licenses, then establish pinned toolchain/dependencies.
- Parallel opportunity: M0-02 reference observation when a lawful EasyWorship
  8.0.49 installation on Windows is available.
- Known qualification needs: real Windows GPU/displays; EasyWorship reference;
  later physical audio/capture/controllers/mobile devices and permitted provider
  accounts. None is assumed available merely because this repo is in an orb.
- Native E2E: not evaluated; M0-03 decides feasibility and records fallback.

## Ticket status index

Only tickets that have started or changed state need entries. Unlisted tickets
remain `planned`. Update the current state above when switching work.

| Ticket | State | Completed slice / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PLAN-001 | done | 63 implementation tickets, 326 ticket checklist items, test/compatibility matrices and commit/resume rules. Documentation verified; delivered in this local planning commit. No application implementation. |

## Session records

### PLAN-001 — Executable roadmap and checkpoint discipline — 2026-10-04

- Request: detailed tickets from zero through release, resumable checklists,
  explicit test boundaries, comprehensive EasyWorship feature/layout/UX coverage,
  optimization and feasible E2E, with commits per ticket or partial ticket.
- Scope: repository documentation only; no GitHub issues, pushes or app changes.
- Decisions: track build-specific reference evidence separately from public
  feature descriptions; leave provider/legal and physical hardware gates explicit.
  Keep native E2E conditional, without weakening manual/hardware acceptance.
- Sources: existing `docs/plan.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, official EasyWorship feature
  page and search results linked in `docs/backlog.md`; no installed reference
  observation performed and no parity claimed.
- Changes: `docs/backlog.md`, `docs/work-log.md`, root guidance and README/plan links.
- Verification: `git diff --check` passed. Inline Python structure check passed:
  63 unique tickets, 326 ticket checklist items, dependency graph acyclic, all
  ticket references and local Markdown links valid. Reproducible final check below.
- Not run: app/unit/UI/E2E/hardware tests; this is documentation-only and there is
  no runnable application. Reference installation and provider rights remain unverified.
- Delivery: local commit `docs(PLAN-001): add executable backlog and checkpoint rules`;
  no push, GitHub issues, release or deployment performed.
- Resume: start M0-01 by inspecting/pinning upstream GPUI patterns and toolchain;
  no application ticket has been started. Do not jump to the full UI or database.

Documentation verification (run from repository root; Python 3 standard library):

## Copy this record when beginning a ticket or partial slice

```text
### <ticket ID> — <slice title> — <date/timezone>

- State: active | blocked | implemented-unqualified | done | deferred
- Scope / checklist items addressed:
- Dependency and reference observation IDs:
- Decisions / upstream GPUI commit and paths (when applicable):
- Files / durable evidence paths:
- Verification: exact commands + decisive results + environment/build/fixture.
- UI evidence: inspected screenshots/states or interaction/accessibility results.
- Not run: checks and concrete reason; do not report these as passing.
- Remaining checklist / blockers / smallest unblock action:
- Next action: exact command, file/function or observation to resume with.
- Delivery: local partial/completed commit; pushed/published only if actually done.
```

Include the log/checklist update in the same commit as its implementation slice.
Use `git log --grep='<ticket ID>'` to find commits; no need to amend a commit merely
to put its own hash in this file. A blocked partial slice may be committed with
failing checks disclosed, but cannot be marked done or qualified.
